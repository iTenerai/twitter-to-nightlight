# How to install

### Firefox
Get it now: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twitter-to-nightlight/

### Chrome, Edge, Opera & other chromium-based browsers
I am currently waiting for the extension to be reviewed and accepted, for now, you can do the following:

In Chrome or any other chromium browser (Opera, Edge, ..):
- Navigate to chrome://extensions/
- Enabled developer mode in the top right corner
- Drag and drop the twitter-to-nightlight-chromium.crx file there

You can find the file in releases labeled Chromium: https://github.com/iTenerai/twitter-to-nightlight/releases/tag/cr-1.0
